    <p>The Vision for Faith Church is to be a like-minded people committed to Loving, Learning, and Living Jesus. We believe in a “Shepherding” Ministry(Luke 15) . . . to discover the lost . . . recover the hurting . . . and restore the wandering sheep of Gallatin and Sumner County, and, through passionate worship and purposeful discipleship, equip them to become completely committed followers of Jesus. The goal here is not to attract a crowd or win a fan base . . . it is simply to make disciples.</p>

            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="scriptures"><h1>The Scriptures</h1>
            <p>
                We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired; that it is truth without any mixture of error; and therefore is, and shall remain to the end of the age, the only complete and final revelation of the will of God to man. As described by Paul in his letter to Timothy, we believe that “all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:16-17)
                <ul class="bullet">
                  <li>By "The Holy Bible" we mean that collection of sixty-six books, from Genesis to Revelation, which as originally written does not only contain and convey the Word of God but IS the very Word of God. </p>
                  <li>By "Inspiration" we mean that the books of the Bible were written by holy men of old as they were moved by the Holy Spirit in such a definite way that their writings were supernaturally and verbally inspired and free from error as no other writings have ever been or ever will be inspired
                  </ul></div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="holy-spirit"><h1>The Holy Spirit</h1>
            <p> We believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person equal with God the Father and God the Son and of the same nature; that He was active in the Creation, and in His relation to the unbelieving world He restrains the evil one until God's purpose is fulfilled; that He convicts of sin, of judgment and of righteousness; that He bears witness to the Truth of the Gospel in preaching and testimony; that He is the agent in the New Birth; and that He seals, endues, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies and helps the believer.
                </p></div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="creation"><h1>The Creation</h1>
            <p>We believe in the Genesis account of creation; that man was created directly in God's own image and after His own likeness; and that man's creation was not a matter of evolution or evolutionary change of species, or developments through interminable periods of time from lower to higher forms.
                </p></div>

            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="true-god"><h1>The True God</h1>
            <p>We believe that there is one, and only one, living and true God -- the Maker and Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth who is holy and worthy of all possible glory and honor and love; and that in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, equal in every divine perfection, and executing the great work of redemption.
                </p></div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="devil"><h1>The Devil or Satan</h1>
            <p>We believe that Satan was once holy and enjoyed heavenly honors, but through pride and ambition to be as the Almighty, he fell and drew after him a host of angels; and that he is now the prince of the power of the air and the unholy god of this world. We hold him to be man's great tempter, the enemy of God, the accuser of the saints, and the author of all the powers of darkness -- destined, however, to final defeat at the hands of God's Son and to the judgment of an eternal justice in hell, a place prepared for him and his angels.
                </p></div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="man"><h1>The Fall of Man</h1>
            <p>We believe that man was created in innocence under the law of his Maker, but by voluntary transgression fell from his sinless and happy state, in consequence of which all mankind are now sinners, and therefore under just condemnation without defense or excuse.

Its officers of ordination are pastors, elders, and deacons -- whose qualifications are clearly defined in the Scriptures. We believe the true mission of the Church is found in the Great Commission: First, to make individual disciples; Second, to build up the Church; Third, to teach and instruct as He commanded.

                        <p>New Testament baptism is the immersion of a believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. It is an act of obedience, not a condition of salvation or cleansing, symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried and risen Savior and the believer's death to sin, the burial of the old life and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus as Lord.

In essence, no one can earn their salvation and no one can lose it. It is a complete act of grace from God and God alone.
