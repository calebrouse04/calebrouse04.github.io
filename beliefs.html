    <p>The Vision for Faith Church is to be a like-minded people committed to Loving, Learning, and Living Jesus. We believe in a “Shepherding” Ministry(Luke 15) . . . to discover the lost . . . recover the hurting . . . and restore the wandering sheep of Gallatin and Sumner County, and, through passionate worship and purposeful discipleship, equip them to become completely committed followers of Jesus. The goal here is not to attract a crowd or win a fan base . . . it is simply to make disciples.</p>

    <h1>Statement of Faith</h1>
    <div class=belief-grid-item id="statement">
      <p>
        We hold a firm dedication to the principles of historical Christian orthodoxy, 
        which is evident in our affirmation of widely accepted statements of faith such as the Nicene Creed and Apostles’ Creed. 
        Being affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, 
        we also embrace the Baptist Faith and Message 2000. Here is a summary of our fundamental doctrinal beliefs.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="belief-grid-container"> <!--grid container-->
        <div class="belief-grid-section-left"><!--grid section beginning-->
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="triune"><h1>The Triune God</h1>
            <p>We believe in one God, eternally existing in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three persons are co-eternal and co equal and know, love, and glorify one another. This is the one true and living God who is worthy of all glory and devotion</p>
              <p class="scripture-reference">Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4-6; Matthew 28:19; John 14:26; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Titus 3:6</p>
                </div>
          
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="humanity"><h1>Humanity</h1>
            <p>God created humanity, both male and female, after His image, in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, to hold dominion over creation. In God’s mysterious providence, humans, by the influence of Satan, chose to rebel against God, resulting in divine wrath. Unless they experience a unique act of grace, humans are unable to reconcile with God. This inherent depravity affects every aspect of their being, including their thoughts, choices, and emotions. As a result, people who have fallen into sin are in a state of hopelessness and are lost, except for the salvation offered exclusively through Christ</p> 
              
              <p class="scripture-reference">Genesis 1:26-27; Psalm 139:13-16; Colossians 3:10;
              Ephesians 4:24; Genesis 3; Ecclesiastes 7:29; Romans 3:10-18; 5:12; Ephesians 2:3</p> 
          </div>

          <div class="belief-grid-item" id="church"><h1>The Church</h1>
            <p>The Church is not merely a physical place or an activity, but a spiritual entity comprised of redeemed individuals. Jesus Christ serves as the head of the church, while believers function as members of His Body. The New Testament provides clear teachings on the formation and perpetuation of local churches. Within these local assemblies, God’s people receive nurturing, encouragement, and equipping for ministry. The primary mission of the Church is to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ to the world</p>

              <p class="scripture-reference">Ephesians 2:19-22, 3:14-19, 4:12; 1 Corinthians 12:12–13, 27; Romans 12:4-8; Ephesians 1:22-23 </p>
          </div>

        <div class="belief-grid-section-right"><!--grid section beginning-->
          <div class="belief-grid-item" id="true-god"><h1>Scripture</h1>
            <p>We embrace the profound truth of the Bible, which is the infallible account of God’s self- disclosure to humanity. It is flawlessly inspired by God; therefore, in its original writings is without error in all it teaches. This infallible guide serves as the ultimate authority, offering unwavering direction for Christian beliefs, conduct, and spirituality</p> 
              
              <p class="scripture-reference">Isaiah 55:11; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; Romans 15:14; Matthew 24:35; Hebrews 4:12-13; 2 Peter 1:19-21 </p>
          </div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="devil"><h1>Salvation</h1>
            <p>Sin is a pervasive reality that separates humanity from a holy God. However, salvation has been accomplished through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life and willingly offered Himself as a sacrificial substitute for our sins. This salvation is applied to individuals through union with Christ. By placing their faith in Jesus, believers are united with Him in a
              profound, legal, and transformative way. Through this union, they receive the forgiveness of sins and are reconciled with God, experiencing the transformative power of His grace, and receiving the gift of eternal life. This union with Christ not only secures their salvation but also enables them to live in a restored relationship with God, empowered by His Spirit to grow in holiness and conformity to the image of Christ </p>

            </div>
            <div class="belief-grid-item" id="baptism"><h1>Baptism and the Lord's Supper</h1>
            <p>We believe that both baptism and the Lord's Supper hold significant importance as they are
              established by the Lord Jesus himself. Baptism is connected to our entrance into the new
              covenant community, while the Lord's Supper represents continuous covenant renewal and
              ordinary means of grace. These practices serve as a divine assurance from God to us and
              demonstrate our public devotion to Christ. 
              </p>

  <div class="belief-grid-item" id="restoration"><h1>The Restoration of All Things</h1>
  <p>
    We believe in the triumphant return of our Lord Jesus Christ and the resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. 
    The unrighteous will face eternal conscious punishment in hell, while the righteous will experience eternal blessedness in the presence of Him who sits on the throne and the Lamb. 
    On that day, the church will be presented blameless by Christ, and his followers will be captivated by the indescribable holiness of his presence. 
    All things will be centered on praising his magnificent grace
